# mechWar

## Introduction

- The main reason for doing this project is to practice the unity mechanism, such as prefab, collider, effects, animation, model, sound, etc., and to clarify some concepts.
- This project is a game made for **practice**, so don't be surprised that it contains a lot of bugs!
- This project was compiled and built using Unity 2018.4.18f1 (64-bit).

- There are some related stories inside the game.
- Use **WASD** to move your character, **left mouse** button to shoot, and **blank** button to jump.
